# SimpleBlockchain_CryptoCurrency

A simple crypto currency blockchain based simulator.

Project Detail’s
You will not implement the project from scratch as I know you are stressed and busy, you will be asked only to implement a specific parts.

I will provide three python Jupyter notebook,
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text, I will only use it to interpret the code

First Notebook: https://github.com/MaTraWy/SimpleBlockchain_CryptoCurrency/blob/master/Fast%20TuT.ipynb

The first python code, is a fast tutorial on pycrypto library, we will use it later to do hash and digital signature

Second Notebook: https://github.com/MaTraWy/SimpleBlockchain_CryptoCurrency/blob/master/SimpleBlockChain%20TUTNew.ipynb

The Second python code, is Blockchain Based Crypto Currency (Pay-To-Address Version), in this notebook I implemented the bitcoin that use plain address as input and output to transaction, you should go through the code and understand it, at the end of this file you will see assignment detail’s as you will be asked to make a console interface to use this coin, so you won’t be asked to implement one, only you will be asked to how to use it!.

Third Notebook:
https://github.com/MaTraWy/SimpleBlockchain_CryptoCurrency/blob/master/Simple%20Blockchain%20Assignment%20Version.ipynb

The Third python code, is Blockchain Based Crypto Currency ( Pay-to-PubkeyHash (P2PKH) Version), in this notebook I implemented the bitcoin that use scripts as input and output to transaction, you only won’t be asked to implement it from scratch, just go through the code and you will find at the end of file, some empty function, you will be asked to implement.
